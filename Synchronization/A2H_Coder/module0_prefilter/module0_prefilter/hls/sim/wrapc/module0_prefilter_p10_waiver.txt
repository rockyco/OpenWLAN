DATA-ONLY module: data_in.read() is a DATA stream, not a CONTROL signal.
Module0 (prefilter) has @FSM_REQUIRED: NO - no async control inputs. The module
is a pure FIR filter with continuous data streaming at II=1. All stream reads are
data consumption per FP-ASYNC1. P10 applies only to CONTROL signals.
