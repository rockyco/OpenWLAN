FSM module with correct pattern: data_in.read() at line 96 is a DATA stream inside
the FSM loop that uses non-blocking poll for CONTROL signals (startOffset_in.empty(),
fineOffset_in.empty()). The flagged read is continuous data consumption per FP-ASYNC1.
CONTROL signals already use the correct FSM pattern with !stream.empty() checks.
